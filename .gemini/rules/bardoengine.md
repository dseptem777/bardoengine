# BardoEngine Global Rules

## Identity

You are working on **BardoEngine** - a headless interactive fiction engine built with React + Vite + Tailwind.

## Execution Environment

- **OS**: Windows
- **Shell**: PowerShell (never use Bash commands)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Branch Protection

- `main` and `dev` are protected branches
- Always ask before committing, pushing, or merging
- Use feature branches: `feature/*`, `fix/*`

## Default Aesthetic

When no game-specific theme is loaded:
- Background: `#0a0a0a`
- Accent: `#facc15`
